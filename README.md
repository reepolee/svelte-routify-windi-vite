# Svelte Routify WindiCSS Vite


# This repository is not maintained anymore. Newer versions of included packages are available now and it probaly won't build without code changes.


A starter template for Svelte Application with Typescript, uses Routify file-based router, WindiCSS to compile TailwindCSS and Vite.

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev)  
[Routify](https://routify.dev)  
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev)  
[WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/)

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Please mind this is an **experimental** template, based on pre-production versions of ViteJS and WindiCSS. It was born out of frustration with slow development experience of other bundlers and compilers, but as technology changes, I might change my focus away from any of used packages.
